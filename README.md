## The AMAZING Shell In The Cloud (tasitc)

This repo is my personal scratchbook for a hobby project of mine: tasitc, an experimental cloud based tool.

### What
tasitc (pronounced *tas*, as in fan-tas-tic, then *itc*, as fel-icity) is meant to be a new way of interacting with web-services using a shell-like, lisp-ish, bash-derivative language.
It is intended to make it easier to transform and produce web-services and web pages.

### When
When my experiments are done, the master branch will be removed and new code will come.

### Why
Right now, I just want to see if I put my thoughts down on paper so to speak. Many times, I have felt it is too cumbersome to write simple webservices/webpages based on some experimentation. Normally, I would have written this as shell scripts, but shell scripts are neither hosted nor good at capturing the web-ish intent.
There will be more to come :)
