## The AMAZING Shell In The Cloud (tasitc)

This repo is my personal scratchbook for a hobby project of mine: tasitc, an experimental cloud based tool.

### What
tasitc (pronounced *tas*, as in fan-tas-tic, then *itc*, as fel-icity) is meant to be a new way of interacting with web-services using a shell-like, bash-ish, lisp-derivative language.
It is intended to make it easier to transform and produce web-services and web pages.

### When
When my experiments are done, the master branch will be removed and new code will come.

### Why
Right now, I just want to put my thoughts down on paper so to speak.
Still, here are some imaginary use cases:
 - transforming javascript from some cdn
 - transforming and aggregating webservices
 - simple and extensible admin pages or any throw-away webpages (landing pages, etc etc)

There will be more to come :)
