# First entry

The journal starts late.
I am sitting here trying to figure out why the hell I decided on delaying progress by rewriting from scratch in C99.

I like the simple grammar of MPC and I couldn't find something similiar for JS. My wife tells my that I'm the person she knows that's the worst at searching for things though.
That cannot be it. I think it is because I am scared of what the 'hackers' at hacker news thinks of JS. It is so popular to hate JS and I figure there's plenty of reason already to hate on tasitc, without throwing JS into the mix.
The hardest, but decidely most fun, part has figuring out the grammar, the syntax ... the use case for crying out loud!
I am happy with the syntax now I think. I find it masculine, if lisp is the definition of feminine (all those parens and curbs!)...
The addition of type annotations makes it even more so.
