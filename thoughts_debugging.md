# Debugging

A thought on debugging in lsh (lim shell):

ctrl-r to run
ctrl-shift-d to debug

When you hit debug, you see the return type of all the functions you call as you see them and step through each block / function etc...
Maybe even stepping into them? Or maybe that's too hard... Not in first release :P :)
